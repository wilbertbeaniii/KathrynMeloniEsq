Note that retainer fee is an up-front amount, but you will be billed at my hourly fee and said amount will be deducted from the retainer each month. You are expected to maintain a minimum retainer of at least $500.00 on account.
* Could be more depending on facts of case or combination of issues. We can also offer, in some custody and support matters, a flat-fee limited involvement representation in the case and charge less for strictly the initial processing (ie filing the complaint) with only the first hearing covered. This is on a case by case basis.

Estate Administration:
Although many attorneys charge a percentage for these types of cases, we charge an hourly rate so you are not paying more just because your estate is large. Initial consultations at hourly rate and probate fees have to be paid up front, but once the estate account is opened, you will be reimbursed and it will come out of the estate account. All other fees and costs will come from the estate account.
I bill for my estate paralegal's work at $140.00/hour.
